  <title>Something about hardware</title>

<h1>something about hardware</h1>

<p>So, the story starts with a growing curiosity on all the incomprehensible stuff that goes on within my computer.
  <br>Technology and coding seemed so beyond my reach, and since I decided some years ago to not let that stop me, I wanted to get more confident around hardware.
  <br>Especially since the building process is exactly why I love programming - and why I am now super into soldering ha ha.
  <br><br>Consider this my log of progression and fun..

  <br>My sweet friend Mihaela invited me to this event at the <a href="https://softer.global" target="_blank"><b>SOFTER LAB</b></a> in Østerbro.
  <br>We spent the evening in a room full of women and queers just supporting each other in learning to build computers from scratch. It was <b>GREAT</b>.
  <br>Outrageously cool Ida, who is co-founder at SOFTER, guided us through the whole process, and eventually we had built two working computers equipped with Windows 11 and everything.

  <br><br>I cannot begin to describe the enthusiasm ignited in me by this learning space. It gives me so much confirmation in the idea that everyone can learn and get excited about technology in the right (read: supportive) environment.
  <br>I will document the technical bits <a href="cool-stuff.html"><span>here</span></a>, on this page I will just continue to gush about how much fun I'm having building stuff.

  <br>I went to <a href="https://bornhack.dk/bornhack-2025/" target="_blank">BornHack</a> with my friend Cecil, and besides meeting some great people and attending interesting talks and hanging out in hammocks, we also built some stuff.
  <br>On my first night we made LED earrings, soldering little LED lights together and adding a battery amd some hooks to wear through the ears.
  <br>Unfortunately I didn't document this, but I will make some more not that I am a bit better at soldering and have had more time for design ideas.
  <br>I was also made to promise to pass on the knowledge by the workshop facilitator as part of the collective responsibility - quite nice, I will definitely borrow this manifesto for later workshops.

  <br><br>Later during the camp we also competed in a soldering contest facilitated by the awesome <a href="https://hackwinkel.nl/" target="_blank">Theo Borm</a>.
  <br>We were tasked to solder 200 tiny LEDs and 100 tiny capacitors and whoever finished first were the winner. I came in 4th.
  <br>Once done we each got a microcontroller, four buttons and some very small transistors to solder to the print plate, and when we were done Theo had made a simple tetris program for the console.
  <br>To read more about the technical process go <a href="cool-stuff.html"><span>here</span></a>, otherwise enjoy this cute gif of the game:
